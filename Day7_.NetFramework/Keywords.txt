	keywords should be written in small case.

	For E.G: class, static, void, int, float,etc


using : is called as preprocessor directive.
	To include inbuilt and user defined namespaces in your program

\t - tab

Comments : Comments are used to describe your code.
		purpose is documentation.

Two types of comments
1) Single line comment	Syntax: 	// statements;
	to comment only one line

2) Multiline comment
	to comment more than one line
	/*

	statements;;

	*/


Variable: It is a named location in memory which holds some value.
	Whose value can be changed in every execution.

	For E.G: Rollno, seatno, contact, emailid, address, etc


Constant : It is same as variable but value never gets changed. Value will be remains constant.
	use const keyword to declare constant variable.
NOTE: when you declare const variable, you can't omit initialization.

For E.G: name, basicsal, dob,etc 

Datatype: What kind of data you want to store in variable is called as Datatype.

Types
int 		plain numbers	For E.G:	Age, month
long		plain numbers but > than int	For E.G: Contact, etc
float		plain numbers and decimal For E.G: salary,rate,etc
double		plain numbers and decimal For E.G: turnover,etc
char		only one character	For E.G:	grade, gender,etc 'A'
string		More than one character For E.G: name,addr,etc
bool 		true, false 	  For E.G: Pass/Fail, etc


1byte = 8 bits
byte		1byte		8 bits
short		2 bytes		16 bits
int 		4bytes		32bits
long		8bytes		64 bits
float 		4bytes		32bits
double		8bytes		64bits
char		2bytes		16bits
bool		1byte		8bits


float.Parse()	: To convert input from string to float
Convert.ToSingle()


int.Parse()	:-	4bytes conversion
Int64.Parse() : 	To convert input from string to int 8 bytes
Int32.Parse() :	To convert input from string to int 4 bytes
Int16.Parse()
Convert.ToInt32()
Convert.ToInt16(), etc
