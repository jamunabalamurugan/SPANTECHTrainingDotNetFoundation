Candidate Key
Primary Key(PK)
Alternate Key
Composite Key-A singlr attribute cannot be used to identify rows uniquely....a combination of two or  more attributes is used as a Primary Key

Foreign Key-When A PRIMARY Key of one table appears as an attribute in another table,it is called the Foreign Key in the second table. 
A foreign Key is used to relate two tables.You must ensure that the values of the FK match with any one value of PK.

Department-Depcode(PK),Name,Location,DepHead(FK)
	   PHY,Physics,P-Block,0089
	   MAT,Maths,M-Block,0145
	   CHE,Chemistry,C-Block,0127

Faculty-FacultyCode(PK),Name,Depcode(FK),Skills,Subject,Experience,DateOfBirth
	0089,David Shaw,PHY,......
	0145,Daniel T,MAT,....
	0127,Tony C,CHE,....
	0024,Jim,IT,

Data Integrity

Entity,Domain,Referntial

Entity-Primary Key
Domain-Range of Valid entries for a given column
Referential-ensures that For every  value of Foreign key,ther is a matching value of the Primary Key

2 NF
ECode+ProjectCode(Composite Key),Dept,Hours

EmployeeDept Table....1.Ecode,Dept
Project Table...2.Ecode,ProjectCode,Hours

3NF
Every attribute in the row is functionally dependent upon the whole key and not just part of the key...
There should not be any Transitive Dependency


it should be in 2NF and every non key attribute is functionally dependent only on the primary key
EmployeeDept Table....1.Ecode,Dept,DepHead

Employee-Ecode,Dept
Department-Dept,DepHead

Denormalization

The intentional introduction of redundancy in a table in order to improve the performance is called denormalization
Eg.Orders
OrderNo,ProductId,Qty

Products
ProductId,Desc,Cost


Orders
OrderNo,ProductId,Qty,ProductCost,Tax,OrderCost
